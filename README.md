### Vercel

To use Vercel with my pipeline, first I went to the Vercel website and signed in using my Github. Then, I was able to link the assignment repository to Vercel. Then, using the Vercel documentation (https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-use-github-actions-with-vercel), I was able to use Vercel to deploy the web app automatically using the pipeline.
